	<main id="skip">
		<p>Shanghai is the city with the most coffee shops in the world.
		   According to Shanghai Coffee Consumption Index report published last year,
		   Shanghai has nearly 7,000 coffee shops. Therefore, the good news is that 
		   you don't actually need to do research beforehand to find a really nice 
		   coffee shop in Shanghai during your travel. From chain coffee shops that mainly
		   serve the white collar workers to speciality coffee shops where people can enjoy 
		   their time talking about coffee beans with friends on weekends, the coffee culture 
		   continues to thrive and influence people's lifestyle in Shanghai.</p>

		<p><a href = "https://roastery.starbucks.com.cn/en/">Shanghai Starbucks Reserve Roastery</a>
			was opened in December 2017. Located on the West Nanjing Road,one of the most famous 
			commercial districts in the city, Shanghai Roastery has become a must-visit attraction 
			for tourists who are coffee lovers. Shanghai Starbucks Reserve Roastery provides its 
			customers an immersive experience of coffee making. The Roastery is the epitome of coffee 
			and retail innovation for Starbucks in China, the company’s fastest growing market with more 
			than 3,000 stores across 136 cities, unprecedented for any global consumer brand and with 
			immense growth opportunity. Starbucks already has over 600 stores in Shanghai – the largest 
			number of stores in any city where Starbucks has a presence.</p>
		
		<p>The Shanghai Roastery features China’s first Teavana Bar, an entirely modern tea 
			experience specifically designed for Chinese customers. While demonstrating deep respect for the 
			thousands of years of Chinese tea tradition, the Teavana Bar reimagines a modern tea 
			experience for customers who increasingly seek new and different tastes and experiences. Customers 
			to the tea experience bar can select a Teavana signature pure tea or blend, served either hot or iced. 
			Using only the finest tea ingredients in the world, tea curators handcraft unexpected creations with 
			tea mixology as well as nitrogen and tea. For those interested in experiencing a whole new brewing method, 
			the Steampunk brings together science and theater. Watch tea leaves dance in the water, while steam extracts 
			every nuanced flavor in one of tea’s most dynamic moments.   Inspired by the traditional clay teapots in China, 
			the tea experience bar is a light jade color with dark shadows to represent tea stains formed in a 
			teapot over time. It is also the only tea bar created from recycled materials using a 3-D printer, 
			measuring 7.5 meters (25 feet) in length.</p>
